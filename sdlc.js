// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

Planning
Analysis of Requirements
Design
Implementation
Maintain
Testing & Integration


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This step involves gathering and analyzing the functional and non-functional requirements of the software. It is critical as it sets the foundation for the entire project and if requirements are not properly captured and understood at this stage, it can lead to significant problems later on."
const design = "This step involves developing the solution to the problem defined in the requirements. The architecture and the components of the system are defined and the interfaces between them are identified."
const implementation = "This step involves actual coding and development of the system. Developers work on implementing the design and building the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "This step is where the system is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as expected. Any bugs or issues that are found are fixed in this stage."
const maintain = "This step is where the system is deployed and made available to the end-users, and ongoing maintenance is performed to ensure that the system continues to function correctly and to make any necessary updates or changes."
